# SingleCell
Single cell Analysis

This repository focuses on the analysis of single-cell RNA sequencing data. Its content covers upstream operations, such as data deconstruction, cell label extraction, and sequence alignment, as well as downstream analyses, including multi-omics integration quality control, clustering, and cross-modal integration. It also incorporates matrix decomposition and clustering significance evaluation. Through teaching methods that involve automated processes, modular scripts, and R language visualization, students can complete the full-process practice of parsing from raw sequencing data to multi-omics cell maps. This not only strengthens their bioinformatics capabilities but also provides technical support for cutting-edge research on genetics and epigenetics.
